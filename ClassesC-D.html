            <br>
            <p class="page5_p">Class C thrives on chaos and intimidation under the leadership of Ryūen Kakeru, a
                ruthless and unpredictable figure who uses fear and brute force to control his classmates. Ryūen’s
                approach is the antithesis of the other classes, as he focuses on dominance and manipulation rather than
                cooperation or mutual respect. This aggressive style often leads to bold and underhanded tactics during
                special exams, where Ryūen leverages his classmates as pawns in his larger schemes. While his methods
                are effective in destabilizing rivals, they create friction within Class C, leading to internal dissent
                and occasional betrayals. Ryūen’s primary rival is Kiyotaka Ayanokōji of Class D, whose calculated
                maneuvers repeatedly thwart Ryūen’s plans and expose his vulnerabilities. Despite these setbacks,
                Ryūen’s resourcefulness and unyielding ambition make Class C a dangerous opponent, as he is willing to
                take risks and push boundaries to secure victory. Class C’s strength lies in their unpredictability,
                though their lack of unity often hampers their ability to achieve sustained success.</p>

                <p class="page3_p">Ryūen Kakeru, the leader of Class 1-C (later 2-C), is a ruthless and intimidating
                    figure known for his aggressive leadership style. Unlike other leaders who rely on charm or
                    strategy, Ryūen uses fear and manipulation to control his class. His philosophy is simple: might
                    makes right. He is not afraid to exploit others' weaknesses or use underhanded tactics to achieve
                    his goals. Despite his brash demeanor, Ryūen is incredibly intelligent and perceptive, often
                    outwitting his opponents in unexpected ways.

                    Ryūen’s ability to adapt to any situation is one of his greatest strengths. He can shift from brute
                    force to psychological warfare, depending on what the situation demands. This flexibility makes him
                    a formidable rival to other class leaders. His rivalry with Ayanokōji is particularly notable, as he
                    recognizes the latter's genius and becomes obsessed with uncovering his true capabilities. Despite
                    his antagonistic nature, Ryūen shows moments of unexpected loyalty and care for his classmates,
                    suggesting there is more to him than his ruthless exterior.

                    Over time, Ryūen evolves as a leader, learning to trust his classmates and rely less on
                    intimidation. This growth does not come easily, as he is forced to confront his own shortcomings and
                    the limits of his leadership style. His willingness to learn and adapt makes him a complex and
                    compelling character. While he remains a wildcard, his determination and tactical brilliance ensure
                    he is always a significant player in the school's competitive environment.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="page5_p">Class D is the lowest-ranked class, often dismissed as the "defective" group at the
                    Advanced Nurturing High School. However, beneath their chaotic exterior lies an evolving force,
                    driven by the enigmatic Kiyotaka Ayanokōji. While officially led by Suzune Horikita, Ayanokōji
                    operates as the true mastermind, manipulating events from behind the scenes to steer Class D toward
                    success. His brilliance is evident in numerous feats, such as orchestrating Class D’s unexpected
                    victory during the island survival test and outmaneuvering Ryūen Kakeru in their climactic
                    confrontation. Ayanokōji’s ability to anticipate the moves of rivals and subtly influence outcomes
                    allows Class D to close the gap with higher-ranked classes, despite their initial disadvantages.
                    Horikita grows into her role as a leader under Ayanokōji’s guidance, but the class still struggles
                    with internal divisions and a lack of cohesion. Ayanokōji’s manipulations are often hidden from his
                    peers, ensuring his involvement remains undetected as he continues to dismantle obstacles and
                    eliminate threats with precision. Despite starting at the bottom, Class D’s gradual rise showcases
                    the potential of an underdog when guided by a strategic genius. Their journey is one of resilience
                    and transformation, making them a compelling and unpredictable force in the school’s competitive
                    hierarchy.

                    <p class="page3_p">Horikita Suzune begins her journey in Classroom of the Elite as a reserved and
                        somewhat aloof student in Class 1-D (later 2-D). She is highly intelligent and analytical,
                        capable of solving complex problems with ease. However, her cold and standoffish demeanor often
                        alienates her classmates. Suzune initially focuses solely on her academic and personal goals,
                        showing little interest in forming relationships or participating in class unity. Her older
                        brother, Horikita Manabu, a third-year and student council president, serves as her primary
                        motivation. She aspires to earn his recognition, which drives her ambition to elevate her class
                        to Class A.

                        Over time, Suzune grows as a leader and becomes more adept at understanding others' emotions and
                        motivations. Her partnership with Ayanokōji Kiyotaka plays a critical role in her development,
                        as his guidance helps her balance her strategic mind with interpersonal skills. Suzune's
                        leadership style evolves into one that blends her sharp intellect with emerging empathy,
                        enabling her to rally her classmates in critical moments. She learns to trust others and
                        delegate responsibilities, breaking away from her initial isolation. Despite her progress, she
                        retains her blunt and straightforward nature, making her a uniquely effective leader who
                        commands respect.

                        Suzune's journey is also marked by her struggle to reconcile her independence with the need for
                        collaboration. Her relationship with her classmates, especially with those like Kushida Kikyo,
                        remains complex, as she learns to navigate trust and betrayal. Suzune's dedication to
                        improvement and her relentless pursuit of excellence make her a central figure in the story. Her
                        tactical thinking and ability to adapt to new challenges ensure her growth continues as the
                        competition between classes intensifies.</p>
