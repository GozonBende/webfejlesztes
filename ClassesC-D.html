            <p class="page5_p">Class C thrives on chaos and intimidation under the leadership of Ryūen Kakeru, a ruthless and unpredictable figure who uses fear and brute force to control his classmates. Ryūen’s approach is the antithesis of the other classes, as he focuses on dominance and manipulation rather than cooperation or mutual respect. This aggressive style often leads to bold and underhanded tactics during special exams, where Ryūen leverages his classmates as pawns in his larger schemes. While his methods are effective in destabilizing rivals, they create friction within Class C, leading to internal dissent and occasional betrayals. Ryūen’s primary rival is Kiyotaka Ayanokōji of Class D, whose calculated maneuvers repeatedly thwart Ryūen’s plans and expose his vulnerabilities. Despite these setbacks, Ryūen’s resourcefulness and unyielding ambition make Class C a dangerous opponent, as he is willing to take risks and push boundaries to secure victory. Class C’s strength lies in their unpredictability, though their lack of unity often hampers their ability to achieve sustained success.</p>

                    MF Bunko J imprint. The series quickly gained a large following due to its unique exploration of

                    follows Kiyotaka Ayanokōji, a highly intelligent but reserved student in Class-D, a section for

                <p class="page5_p">Class D is the lowest-ranked class, often dismissed as the "defective" group at the Advanced Nurturing High School. However, beneath their chaotic exterior lies an evolving force, driven by the enigmatic Kiyotaka Ayanokōji. While officially led by Suzune Horikita, Ayanokōji operates as the true mastermind, manipulating events from behind the scenes to steer Class D toward success. His brilliance is evident in numerous feats, such as orchestrating Class D’s unexpected victory during the island survival test and outmaneuvering Ryūen Kakeru in their climactic confrontation. Ayanokōji’s ability to anticipate the moves of rivals and subtly influence outcomes allows Class D to close the gap with higher-ranked classes, despite their initial disadvantages.
                    Horikita grows into her role as a leader under Ayanokōji’s guidance, but the class still struggles with internal divisions and a lack of cohesion. Ayanokōji’s manipulations are often hidden from his peers, ensuring his involvement remains undetected as he continues to dismantle obstacles and eliminate threats with precision. Despite starting at the bottom, Class D’s gradual rise showcases the potential of an underdog when guided by a strategic genius. Their journey is one of resilience and transformation, making them a compelling and unpredictable force in the school’s competitive hierarchy.
