                <p class="page3_p">As the second year begins, the students of Class D face a new set of challenges in their journey to climb the ranks at the Advanced Nurturing High School. The dynamics of the classes have shifted, and new alliances and rivalries emerge. Kiyotaka Ayanokōji continues to maintain his unassuming facade, even as he observes the rising tensions between his classmates and the arrival of new opponents. The school wastes no time in testing the students, introducing a special exam focused on trust and deception.
                    The exam divides the students into groups named after the zodiac signs, mixing first-years with second-years and creating a highly volatile environment where manipulation and strategy are key. Kiyotaka’s group includes individuals from rival classes, making it a microcosm of the larger battles within the school. His understated yet brilliant tactics are on full display as he navigates the group’s politics while subtly influencing the outcome to his advantage. This volume sets the tone for the second year, emphasizing the increasing complexity of the school’s system and the heightened stakes for every student involved

                <p class="page3_p">The fallout from the zodiac test continues to ripple through the school as relationships and power dynamics are further strained. This volume delves deeply into the aftermath, with students beginning to question their alliances and motivations. Karuizawa Kei finds herself more dependent on Kiyotaka, who continues to pull the strings behind the scenes.
                    The narrative shifts its focus to a new sports festival, where the competition becomes fiercer than ever. Unlike the first year’s event, this festival incorporates second-year students, adding an extra layer of complexity to the strategies employed by each class. Class D struggles to maintain cohesion, and Suzune Horikita faces increasing pressure to prove her worth as a leader. Meanwhile, Kiyotaka observes and intervenes only when necessary, ensuring that his influence remains unnoticed.
                    The volume also introduces new antagonists from the second-year students, further expanding the web of rivalries within the school. Through sharp dialogue and intense competition, this volume explores themes of teamwork, resilience, and the sacrifices required to achieve success in such a brutal environment.

                <p class="page3_p">A major turning point arrives with the announcement of another special exam, this time focused on leadership and negotiation. The test forces each class to elect a leader who will bear the brunt of the consequences should their team fail. Suzune Horikita, now more confident in her role, steps up to lead Class D. However, the challenges she faces are monumental, with rival classes using underhanded tactics to sabotage her efforts.
                    Kiyotaka’s role in this volume becomes even more pivotal as he subtly guides Horikita, helping her anticipate and counter the moves of her opponents. The dynamic between Kiyotaka and Horikita evolves further, showcasing her growing reliance on his intellect and strategy. Meanwhile, Ryūen Kakeru, the unpredictable leader of Class C, re-emerges as a key player, creating chaos and forcing Class D into difficult decisions.
                    This volume is packed with tense confrontations, clever schemes, and moments of character growth. It’s a testament to the series’ ability to balance high-stakes drama with the intricate psychological battles that fans love.

                <p class="page3_p">The students are thrown into a grueling mixed-team survival exam, reminiscent of the island test from the first year but with even harsher conditions. This time, the groups are composed of students from all grades, fostering an environment of mistrust and uneasy alliances. The exam tests not only physical endurance but also mental fortitude and the ability to work with unfamiliar peers.
                    Kiyotaka’s group includes several standout characters from other years, each with their own agenda. Through careful manipulation and keen observation, Kiyotaka steers his group through the challenges, often taking advantage of their assumptions about his abilities. Meanwhile, the tension between rival classes escalates as sabotage and betrayal become commonplace.
                    This volume delves deeply into the psychological toll of the school’s brutal system, highlighting how far students are willing to go to protect their standing. Kiyotaka’s influence grows more evident, even as he continues to operate from the shadows.

However, the respite is short-lived as new challenges loom on the horizon. This volume focuses on character relationships, with Kiyotaka’s dynamic with Kei Karuizawa taking center stage.
                    Kei begins to question her dependence on Kiyotaka while also struggling with her own insecurities and fears. Meanwhile, Kiyotaka reflects on his growing influence over his classmates and the implications of his actions. The volume also provides insight into the motivations of other key players, including Ichika Amasawa, a mysterious figure who becomes increasingly entangled in Kiyotaka’s plans.

Each class is tasked with managing a budget and negotiating deals, with their success or failure impacting their standing. The exam highlights the disparities between the classes, with Class A leveraging their superior resources to dominate the competition.
                    Kiyotaka, however, sees this as an opportunity to expose the weaknesses of his rivals. Through a series of calculated moves, he undermines their efforts while strengthening Class D’s position. The volume also explores the growing tension between Kiyotaka and Nagumo Miyabi, the ambitious president of the student council who views Kiyotaka as both a threat and a challenge.
                    This volume is a fascinating exploration of power dynamics, showcasing the series’ ability to weave complex social and strategic battles into its narrative.
