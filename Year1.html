                <p class="page3_p">Classroom of the Elite begins at the prestigious Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School, an institution renowned for producing Japan’s future leaders. The school offers students a seemingly utopian environment with luxurious facilities, a monthly allowance in points that functions as currency, and complete freedom in managing their lives. However, this freedom comes with a catch: everything is determined by performance, and students must compete to earn points, privileges, and status.
                    We meet Kiyotaka Ayanokōji, an enigmatic and introverted student placed in Class D, the lowest-ranked class known for housing "problematic" students. Initially blending into the background, Kiyotaka observes his ambitious yet socially awkward classmate, Suzune Horikita, who is determined to rise to Class A. The cheerful and seemingly perfect Kikyo Kushida befriends both Kiyotaka and Horikita, though her true intentions remain unclear. As the class begins to unravel the school’s merit-based system, Kiyotaka’s sharp intellect and manipulative skills subtly come into play, hinting at a hidden genius who may be far more than he seems. This volume sets the stage for a thrilling series filled with psychological intrigue and high-stakes competition.

                    Kinugasa and illustrated by Shunsaku Tomose. It began serialization in 2015 through Media Factory’s
                    MF Bunko J imprint. The series quickly gained a large following due to its unique exploration of
                    meritocracy and psychological warfare in a fictional high school setting, the Tokyo Metropolitan

                    follows Kiyotaka Ayanokōji, a highly intelligent but reserved student in Class-D, a section for
                    students deemed “inferior.” The school operates on a strict meritocratic system where students can
                    earn or lose privileges based on their academic and social performance. This intense, competitive
                    environment brings out manipulative, ambitious, and resilient characteristics in students, creating
                    a suspenseful and psychologically rich storyline. Light Novels and Sales The series is divided into
