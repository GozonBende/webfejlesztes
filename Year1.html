                    Kinugasa and illustrated by Shunsaku Tomose. It began serialization in 2015 through Media Factory’s
                    MF Bunko J imprint. The series quickly gained a large following due to its unique exploration of
                    meritocracy and psychological warfare in a fictional high school setting, the Tokyo Metropolitan
                    Advanced Nurturing School, which trains Japan's future elites. Story and Themes The narrative
                    follows Kiyotaka Ayanokōji, a highly intelligent but reserved student in Class-D, a section for
                    students deemed “inferior.” The school operates on a strict meritocratic system where students can
                    earn or lose privileges based on their academic and social performance. This intense, competitive
                    environment brings out manipulative, ambitious, and resilient characteristics in students, creating
                    a suspenseful and psychologically rich storyline. Light Novels and Sales The series is divided into

                <p class="page3_p">Classroom of the Elite is a popular Japanese light novel series written by Shōgo
                    Kinugasa and illustrated by Shunsaku Tomose. It began serialization in 2015 through Media Factory’s
                    MF Bunko J imprint. The series quickly gained a large following due to its unique exploration of
                    meritocracy and psychological warfare in a fictional high school setting, the Tokyo Metropolitan
                    Advanced Nurturing School, which trains Japan's future elites. Story and Themes The narrative
                    follows Kiyotaka Ayanokōji, a highly intelligent but reserved student in Class-D, a section for
                    students deemed “inferior.” The school operates on a strict meritocratic system where students can
                    earn or lose privileges based on their academic and social performance. This intense, competitive
                    environment brings out manipulative, ambitious, and resilient characteristics in students, creating
                    a suspenseful and psychologically rich storyline. Light Novels and Sales The series is divided into
                    two major arcs: the original Classroom of the Elite arc</p>
