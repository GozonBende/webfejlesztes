                    The Japanese government has established the Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing School, dedicated
                    to
                    instruct
                    and foster the generation of people that will support the country in the future. The students are
                    given
                    a
                    high
                    degree of freedom in order to closely mimic real life. The story follows the perspective of Kiyotaka
                    Ayanokōji,
                    a quiet and modest boy, who is bad at making friends and would rather keep his distance, but
                    possesses
                    unrivaled
                    intelligence and incredible physical ability. He is a student of Class-D, which is where the school
                    dumps
                    its
                    inferior students, widely considered "defective". After meeting Suzune Horikita and Kikyō Kushida,
                    two
                    other
                    students in his class, the situation begins to change, and he gets involved in many aff and his
                    thought
                    of
                    an ideal normal high school life begins to get scattered, taking a toll on his sanity.
