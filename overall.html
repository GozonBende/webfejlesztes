                            Classroom of the Elite is a popular Japanese light novel series written by Shōgo Kinugasa
                            and illustrated by Shunsaku Tomose. It began serialization in 2015 through Media Factory’s
                            MF Bunko J imprint. The series quickly gained a large following due to its unique
                            exploration of meritocracy and psychological warfare in a fictional high school setting, the
                            Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing School, which trains Japan's future elites.

                            Story and Themes
                            The narrative follows Kiyotaka Ayanokōji, a highly intelligent but reserved student in
                            Class-D, a section for students deemed “inferior.” The school operates on a strict
                            meritocratic system where students can earn or lose privileges based on their academic and
                            social performance. This intense, competitive environment brings out manipulative,
                            ambitious, and resilient characteristics in students, creating a suspenseful and
                            psychologically rich storyline.

                        The Main Character of the show. He is a 16 years old teenager boy, whose attending to the Tokyo
                        Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing Highschool. At first glance he is just a tottaly avreage boy,
                        his grades are not good but not bad either, his pyshical appearance is not outstanding, he is
                        handsome but not too handsome. A tottaly normal boy in Class D. At least thats what we would
                        tell about him after reading the first few volumes. However thats only the surface of hus
                        character, this is his camoflage. He is a calculating, extremely inteligent, physicaly gifted
                        individual. He can manipulate people and classes as easily as he wakes up. He can expell anyone
                        and can win anything he wants. However due his personality and character ,he tries to lay back
                        and stay hidden. As we progress in the series we can get a gasp of his abilities. He is
                        manipulative, smart, extremely neutral, ruthless and purposeful. His one and only goal is to
                        improve himself and win at any cost, he would sacrifie anything and anyone if that would be
                        nessecery for the sake of victory. The briliancy of his character is that even tho you now that
                        he is not a good person at all, you will enjoy every single minutes of reading his actions,
                        hisbunique thinking and background is interesting, he is suprisingly funny , but can be clumsy
                        at times. He is simply an extremly well written character who earned the fans respect and love.
